Building books with Baker Tilly. 

common eval rules: 

times revenue valu: 

 price x shares / revperyr = valu The result indicates how many times of annual income a buyer was willing to pay for a company. https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/n70LEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0

valu = const like 5 in this industry?

revperyr= scenarioed revenue from BT licensing sched

ioi agreements? examples

budget two yr & license schedu values - 2 vals util and ac 

util - case study deloitte p.e. client management team - 

util estimate: (50% reduction in process time with Jinsei automation) (through configured and running jinsei.ai services requiring operator audit and minor data edits)

Filing workflows:

x10 over 1 month period team size 25

footnote creation and editing on k1 (avg 3 times for each 25 clients) (avg 1 time 2 hours) = 150 h

california tax rule audits filing (1 time for each 25 clients)  (avg 1 time 4 hours) = 100 h

other filing proceses...

estimate 10 things come out to avg 125h each, 1250 total hours for 25 person team = 47ish hour weeks per member 

for 15 person team or a 40% salary expense reduction

80hish weeks per member with same work demand

with jinsei.ai -> 40ish h weeks for the team

license value = avg salary: 90000 X 25 X util: (1-.4) 

2250000 25 person team 

1450000 15 person team 

800000 in value x12 mo license

annual license val for this team: 9600000 

2nd val: budget 2 yr build

calc for systems, business administration, marketing

to get revperyr= scenarioed revenue from BT licensing sched - development partnership or ioi agreement

depending on what they want to do , acquire and align for team licensing, or align for team licensing

align for team testing: offer a license rate at a slightly lower value than the utility or a lockout period from other accounting companies

team licesning schedules are dependent on value observed during team testing and implementation

at least one license schedule must be executed 

share price x 1M(10%) = 2 yr budget 

clauses for BT escape, 

clauses for Jinsei escape

IXBRL Edgar Uptake- The Inline XBRL document format is based on HTML and can be viewed in a browser and used in all the same ways that an HTML document can be viewed and used. As compared to HTML, however, an Inline XBRL document contains additional XML elements and XML attributes that allow the document to be validated and processed as an XBRL instance document. As a result, filers that submit an Inline XBRL document are not required to submit a separate instance document as described in Chapter 6, “Interactive Data,” and EDGAR will not accept an Inline XBRL document that includes a separate instance document in the submission process.

A submission may have more than one attached document formatted using Inline XBRL. Inline XBRL formatted attachments are processed and validated together as an Inline XBRL Document Set (IXDS), as defined by section 3.1 of the Inline XBRL 1.1 Specification, producing a single target instance document. For submissions with an Inline XBRL attachment, all references to “official HTML/ASCII document” in Chapter 6 should be read as “IXDS” All of the validations that apply in Chapter 6 apply to the target instance document.

The Discoverable Taxonomy Set (DTS) of an instance document is the set of all schemas and linkbases that are found by following all URI links and references.

135 rules from xbrl-us  - data quality committee github https://github.com/DataQualityCommittee/dqc_us_rules
they sit in a gh repo sec uses a subset 
the xule editor works with all these rules

## Visuals and Integrated Commericial Envs

NewName - Jinsei Luciano Legacy -  Services, Active Package, APIs, Canvas, services only goes one level down. it has report packages, api code bases, and deployed services in hosted or ci/cd/imagineered packages listed to be selected then shown in active package. 

ok your k1s listed above (service generated report packages), your k1 links visual directory above on the left side (when clicked goes into the active fs), yur k1 final pack, k1 xbrl packs, all listed together, then they get clicked on and it is in the active fs below (all left), when a file from there is clicked it goes into the lower right viewer. 

the right side has the report file infromation and above that is the API connections to company apis and jinsei transformers listed as named services and when clicked they display below as service pipelines with like active status and endpoint creation with the transformers via the ui with modals, so you can be like hey myservice1 call xuri1, 2, and 3 into jinsei.ai-mypersonalk1transformer and connect the dozen type output set with jinsei.ai-mypersonalsecedgarfiler
