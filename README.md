dd:

budget two yr & license schedu values - 2 vals util and ac 

util - case study deloitte p.e. client management team - 

util estimate: (50% reduction in process time with Jinsei automation) (through configured and running jinsei.ai services requiring operator audit and minor data edits)

Filing workflows:

x10 over 1 month period team size 25

footnote creation and editing on k1 (avg 3 times for each 25 clients) (avg 1 time 2 hours) = 150 h

california tax rule audits filing (1 time for each 25 clients)  (avg 1 time 4 hours) = 100 h

other filing proceses...

estimate 10 things come out to avg 125h each, 1250 total hours for 25 person team = 47ish hour weeks per member 

for 15 person team or a 40% salary expense reduction

80hish weeks per member with same work demand

with jinsei.ai -> 40ish h weeks for the team

license value = avg salary: 90000 X 25 X util: (1-.4) 

2250000 25 person team 

1450000 15 person team 

800000 in value x12 mo license

annual license val for this team: 9600000 

2nd val: budget 2 yr build

calc for systems, business administration, marketing

to get revperyr= scenarioed revenue from BT licensing sched - development partnership or ioi agreement

--->> depending on what they want to do , acquire and align for team licensing, or align for team licensing w a lockout period

align for team testing: offer a license rate at a slightly lower value than the utility or a lockout period from other accounting companies

team licesning schedules are dependent on value observed during team testing and implementation

at least one license schedule must be executed 

share price x 1M(10%) = 2 yr budget

IXBRL Edgar Uptake- The Inline XBRL document format is based on HTML and can be viewed in a browser and used in all the same ways that an HTML document can be viewed and used. As compared to HTML, however, an Inline XBRL document contains additional XML elements and XML attributes that allow the document to be validated and processed as an XBRL instance document. As a result, filers that submit an Inline XBRL document are not required to submit a separate instance document as described in Chapter 6, “Interactive Data,” and EDGAR will not accept an Inline XBRL document that includes a separate instance document in the submission process.

A submission may have more than one attached document formatted using Inline XBRL. Inline XBRL formatted attachments are processed and validated together as an Inline XBRL Document Set (IXDS), as defined by section 3.1 of the Inline XBRL 1.1 Specification, producing a single target instance document. For submissions with an Inline XBRL attachment, all references to “official HTML/ASCII document” in Chapter 6 should be read as “IXDS” All of the validations that apply in Chapter 6 apply to the target instance document.

The Discoverable Taxonomy Set (DTS) of an instance document is the set of all schemas and linkbases that are found by following all URI links and references.

135 rules from xbrl-us  - data quality committee github https://github.com/DataQualityCommittee/dqc_us_rules
